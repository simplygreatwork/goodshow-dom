for hover, be able to tween shadow depth

idea: I can use multiple canvases to paint a canvas scenegraph
   draw canvas image onto image

implement image drawing
implement flow & inherit
implement change panel
   requires proxy implementation
work on flow extent
implement drawing
improve card shadow
implement clipping
   for ripples in circular
pixel based hit test

issues with flicker when switching among panels
   but do not see the issue with the miller panel demo

ripple may need pointer-events
   to be able to work without invoke

with this element/canvas strategy, which effects will absolutely require CSS?
   translate, rotate, scale, blur, etc
   
test alpha

my entity API needs methods for translate, rotate, etc.

backdrop canvases must have a transparent background

issue: if I do fixed positioning everywhere, won't be able to scroll or overflow automatically

want to add translate/pivot to Entity
   
   var translate = entity.translate();
   var x = entity.translate().x;
   entity.translate({
      x : 0,
      y : 0
   });
   
   then later on I can use a proxy to listen to entity.translate changes
